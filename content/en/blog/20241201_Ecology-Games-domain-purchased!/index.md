Buying a .eu domain is tricky if you are in the UK!
<!--more-->
Even though, as an Irish Citizen, I can register a .eu domain, I struggled to buy the domain on dreamhost because they don't expose all of the requried addresses explicitly.

I was being rejected because my billing address was in the UK.

I found a different registrare (namecheap) who were more explicit about the various addresses and thus I was able to register the domain.

We have the domain for about 5 years and we can revisit then!
